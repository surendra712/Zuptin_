### Step 2: Google Cloud Console Setup

   ```

### Step 3: Email Templates (Optional)

## 🎯 How It Works

### Forgot Password Flow:

2. Modal opens asking for email address
3. User enters email and clicks "Send Reset Link"
4. Supabase sends password reset email
5. User clicks link in email → redirected to `/reset-password`
6. User enters new password with validation
7. Password is updated and user is redirected to sign-in

### Google Authentication Flow:
1. User clicks "Continue with Google"
2. Redirected to Google OAuth consent screen
3. User selects Google account and grants permissions
4. Google redirects back to your app
5. Supabase creates/logs in user automatically
6. User is redirected to dashboard
